## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bin/rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `marketo_api/version.rb`, and then run `bin/rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Testing

- To run the test suite, run `bin/rake`
- Check Coverage by running `open coverage/index.html` from the gem root
